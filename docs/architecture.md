# Definitions

A **light wallet** is not a full participant in the network of VerusCoin peers. It can send and receive payments, but does not store or validate a copy of the blockchain.

A **compact transaction** is a representation of a VerusCoin transaction that contains only the information necessary to detect that a given payment output is for you and to spend a note.

A **compact block** is a collection of compact transactions along with certain metadata (such as the block header) from their source block.

## Ingester

The ingester is the component responsible for transforming raw Zcash block data into a compact block.

The ingester is a modular component. Anything that can retrieve the necessary data and put it into storage can fulfill this role. Currently, the only ingester available communicated to verusd through RPCs and parses that raw block data. 

**How do I run it?**

⚠️ This section literally describes how to execute the binaries from source code. This is suitable only for testing, not production deployment. See section Production for cleaner instructions.

⚠️ Bringing up a fresh compact block database can an hour of uninterrupted runtime. The delay will slowly increase as the VerusCoin blockchain increases in size over time as well.

First, install [Go >= 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/#stable). Older versions of Go may work but are not actively supported at this time. Note that the version of Go packaged by Debian stable (or anything prior to Buster) is far too old to work.

Now clone this repo and start the ingester. The first run will start slow as Go builds the disk based cache files. Note that we are disabling security to simplify and speed things up. That's reasonable for a test server that is not exposed, but certs and no -plaintext will be important in any production or exposed severs.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/asherda/lightwalletd
$ cd lightwalletd
$ swig -go  -intgosize 64 -c++ -cgo -gccgo -Wall -v parser/verushash/verushash.i
$ make
$ ./lightwalletd --verus-conf-path ~/.komodo/VRSC/VRSC.conf --log-file /logs/server.log --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:18232 --no-tls-very-insecure
```

To see the other command line options, run `go run main.go --help`.

## Frontend

The frontend is the component that talks to clients. 

It exposes an API that allows a client to query for current blockheight, request ranges of compact block data, request specific transaction details, and send new Zcash transactions.

The API is specified in [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and implemented using [gRPC](https://grpc.io). You can find the exact details in [these files](https://github.com/asherda/lightwalletd/tree/master/walletrpc).

**How do I run it?**

⚠️ This section literally describes how to execute the binaries from source code. This is suitable only for testing, not production deployment. See section Production for cleaner instructions.

First, install [Go >= 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/#stable). Older versions of Go may work but are not actively supported at this time. Note that the version of Go packaged by Debian stable (or anything prior to Buster) is far too old to work.

Now clone this repo and start the frontend. The first run will start slow as Go builds the sqlite C interface:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/asherda/lightwalletd
$ cd lightwalletd
$ swig -go  -intgosize 64 -c++ -cgo -gccgo -Wall -v parser/verushash/verushash.i
$ make
$ ./lightwalletd --chain-name VRSC --verusd-url 127.0.0.1:27486 --verusd-user user --verusd-password pass --log-file /logs/server.log --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:18232 --no-tls-very-insecure 
```
To see the other command line options, run `go run main.go --help`.

**What should I watch out for?**

x509 Certificates! This software relies on the confidentiality and integrity of a modern TLS connection between incoming clients and the front-end. Without an x509 certificate that incoming clients accurately authenticate, the security properties of this software are lost.

Otherwise, not much! This is a very simple piece of software. Make sure you point it at the same storage as the ingester. See the "Production" section for some caveats.

Support for users sending transactions will require the ability to make JSON-RPC calls to a verusd instance. By default the frontend tries to pull RPC credentials from your VRSC.conf file, but you can specify other credentials via command line flag. In the future, it should be possible to do this with environment variables

## Storage

The storage provider is the component that caches compact blocks and their metadata for the frontend to retrieve and serve to clients.

It currently uses 2 db-main* files in the default directory when it starts. We expect that anyone deploying lightwalletd at scale will adapt it to their own existing data infrastructure.

**How do I run it?**

It's not necessary to explicitly run anything, the default directory's torage is automatically used. 

**What should I watch out for?**

If run in a container, map the db-main* file's directory to an external directory on the host. If you don't map it then the files are lost if and when the cotainer stops, forcing another reload the next time it starts.
## Production

⚠️ This is informational documentation about a piece of alpha software. It has not yet undergone audits or been subject to rigorous testing. It lacks some affordances necessary for production-level reliability. We do not recommend using it to handle customer funds at this time (March 2019).

**x509 Certificates**
You will need to supply an x509 certificate that connecting clients will have good reason to trust (hint: do not use a self-signed one, our SDK will reject those unless you distribute them to the client out-of-band). We suggest that you be sure to buy a reputable one from a supplier that uses a modern hashing algorithm (NOT md5 or sha1) and that uses Certificate Transparency (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2 will be present in the certificate).

To check a given certificate's (cert.pem) hashing algorithm:
```
openssl x509 -text -in certificate.crt | grep "Signature Algorithm"
```

To check if a given certificate (cert.pem) contains a Certificate Transparency OID:
```
echo "1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2 certTransparency Certificate Transparency" > oid.txt
openssl asn1parse -in cert.pem -oid ./oid.txt | grep 'Certificate Transparency'
```

To use Let's Encrypt to generate a free certificate for your frontend, one method is to:
1) Install certbot
2) Open port 80 to your host
3) Point some forward dns to that host (some.forward.dns.com)
4) Run
```
certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d some.forward.dns.com
```
5) Pass the resulting certificate and key to frontend using the -tls-cert and -tls-key options.

**Dependencies**

The first-order dependencies of this code are:

- Go (>= 1.11 suggested; older versions are currently unsupported)

**Containers**

This software was designed to be container-friendly! We highly recommend that you package and deploy the software in this manner. We've created an example Docker environment that is likewise new and minimally tested, but it's functional.

**What's missing?**

lightwalletd currently lacks several things that you'll want in production. Caveats include:

- There are no monitoring / metrics endpoints yet. You're on your own to notice if it goes down or check on its performance.
- Logging coverage is patchy and inconsistent. However, what exists emits structured JSON compatible with various collectors.
- Logging may capture identifiable user data. It hasn't received any privacy analysis yet and makes no attempt at sanitization.
- The only storage provider implemented uses files in the default directory.
- [Load-balancing with gRPC](https://grpc.io/blog/loadbalancing) may not work quite like you're used to. A full explanation is beyond the scope of this document, but we recommend looking into [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), [nginx](https://nginx.com), or [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org) depending on your existing infrastructure.
